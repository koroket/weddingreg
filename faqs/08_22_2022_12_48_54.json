{"_id":{"$oid":"6303015eb8b7ff47a52ac9b1"},"question":"So is this a wedding or a baby shower?","answer":"It's a mix of both. Originally we were planning on it being a wedding, but the way things are, it will be a bit harder to do some of the more traditional wedding parts. So we will skip some of the formalities and replace it with things that are more baby shower like. Otherwise, it's a nice wedding venue, with wedding tier dining!","position":4,"unanswered":false,"originator":"","__v":0}
